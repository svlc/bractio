all usefull info -- game release version,
replay length, list of players (TODO), winners (TODO),
APM (Actions Per Minute) (TODO), ...
---------------------------------------------------------
VERSION:
Very early version, lot of things are to be done.
---------------------------------------------------------
USAGE:
After "make" command (zlib is required), library gets
compiled with "src/main.c" source file. The binary
should show up in "bin" directory. To see usage, run
the program with no arguments. Sample replays to test
the library can be found in "samples" directory.
---------------------------------------------------------
INNARDS:
Replay header gets parsed, then, based on header info,
several encoded data blocks are loaded and decoded by
zlib library. That is all the library does right now.
